1.What happens when the number of hidden nodes increase?

As the number of hidden nodes increases, the neural network's ability to learn complex patterns in the data improves, enhancing both training and validation accuracy initially. However, after a certain point, the model may begin to overfit, learning the training data too thoroughly, including noise, and resulting in poorer performance on new, unseen data.

2.Can you explain the pattern of the accuracy when the hidden nodes increase?


Initial Increase: The model's accuracy improves as it captures more patterns.
Optimal Point: Validation accuracy peaks when the model has just the right capacity.
Overfitting: After this peak, validation accuracy may decline due to overfitting, while training accuracy continues to rise or levels off.
